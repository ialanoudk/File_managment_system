 1. File Management System 
	1.1 Project Description

The project is based on managing user files in general in the system.
Where the user chooses from the menu whether he wants to know the list of all files in the directory in the system or manage all files.
The user can manage files by creating a new file, writing within a specified file,
reading from a specified file, deleting a file, and searching for a specified file.
The files will be managed by giving the user a clarification if the process was done correctly or not through a printing process after each process specified by the user.
E.g., if the user searches for a file in a specific folder but that file was previously deleted by the user, it will print 'Directory is empty' or 'Directory is not empty'.
